# Difference between Paramenters vs Arguments

### Paramenters:
Parameters are the names used in function definitions. It is like a placeholder for the argments that will be passed to the functions.

E.g. Below the names `value1` and `value2` are the parameters.

```python
def multi (value1, value2):
    return value1 * value2
```

### Arguments

An arugument is the actual value that is passed to the function when it is called. They are placed within the parenthesis `()` when the function is callled. It can be a value, variable, class, or function that is passed.

E.g. The values `1` and `2` are arguments that are passsed to the funcion `multi`. The variables `a` and `b` are argumenst passed to the function.

```python
ans = multi(1,2)
ans1 = multi(a,b)
```
